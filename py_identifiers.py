#Rules for writing identifiers
#1.Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase
#   (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_).
#   Names like myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen, all are valid example.
#2.An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, but variable1
#   is perfectly fine.
#3.Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
#4.We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. in our identifier.
#5.Identifier can be of any length.
#6.Python is a case-sensitive language. This means, Variable and variable are not the same.
